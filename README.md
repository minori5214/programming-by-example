# Programming-by-example (PBE)

Programming-by-example (PBE) is a method that enables non-programmers to process data with ease. 
In this repository, I implemented the FLASHFILL [1] algorithm that synthesizes string transformation program from input-output examples provided by users.
To run PBE, you just type

```
python main.py
```
